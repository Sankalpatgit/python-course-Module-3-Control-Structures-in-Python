# Project: Control Structures in Python

## Overview
This project contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of control structures like `if-else` and `for loops` in Python.

### Files Included
1. **task1.py**: Checks whether a number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
2. **task2.py**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

## File Details

### 1. `task1.py` - Even or Odd Check
This program takes a number as input from the user and checks whether it is even or odd using an `if-else` control structure.

**Example Input:**
```
Enter a number: 6
```
**Output:**
```
6 is an even number.
```

**Example Input:**
```
Enter a number: 7
```
**Output:**
```
7 is an odd number.
```

### 2. `task2.py` - Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
This program uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.

**Output:**
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

2. **Run the Programs:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Run the desired program using the following commands:
      
      For `task1.py`:
      ```bash
      python task1.py
      ```
      
      For `task2.py`:
      ```bash
      python task2.py
      ```
